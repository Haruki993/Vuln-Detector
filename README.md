# VulnDetector

**VulnDetector** is a simple Python tool to help you quickly check if a website implements key HTTP security headers. These headers help protect sites from common web vulnerabilities.

## Features

- Checks for common security headers such as:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-Frame-Options
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - Referrer-Policy
  - Permissions-Policy
- Easy to use command-line interface
- Graceful error handling for invalid URLs or connection issues
- Lightweight with minimal dependencies

1. Clone or download this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/VulnDetector.git
cd VulnDetector

2. Create a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python vuln_detector.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a website URL (including `http://` or `https://`):

```
Enter website URL (with http/https): https://example.com
```

The tool will then display which security headers are present or missing.

## Example Output

```
